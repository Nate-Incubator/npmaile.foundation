<b>The Nate Stream Incubator Foundation is a joke (much like Nate himself).</b>

This site serves as a frontend for the collection of projects created by the "fanbase" of D-list tech streamer "npmaile".

Our Ethos:

  - Only projects of the utmost quality and vision will be accepted to the Nate Incubator
  - Projects with excessive dependencies will be frowned upon
  - Arch is the best operating system read about it on my blog
  - The official stance of this Organization is that the United States is the best.
  - Because of rule #1 Nate is unable to participate, so the foundation was created in his absence.

Unironically, we exist to build fun stuff and further ourselves as devs.

You can find the source code for all of our projects <a href="https://github.com/nate-incubator">On our github organization.</a>

You're also encouraged to <a href="https://discord.gg/natestream">Join the Nate Stream Discord</a> and come lurk in voicechat.
